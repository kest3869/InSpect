# InSpect v2.0
Classifying SPECT scans of psychiatric pathologies using deep learning techniques. 

## Project Overview
Development will use python instead of jupyter notebooks, have a torch backend instead of keras, and be done inside of docker containers. This will provide a more portable and scalable platform for the long term development of the InSpect project. 

## Technical Updates
- published research approaches will be re-created and benchmarked on the problem
- more care will be taken with initial data loading and labelling 
- data will never be mixed and only clean data will be used for model fitting
- data will be stored as a pre-processed torch dataset 
- 2d approaches will be explored for better training speed, model diversity, and pre-trained model availability
- advanced data-augmentation techniques will be introduced to prevent over-fitting and balance dataset

## Legacy 
Contains first iteration of project coded in jupyter notebooks with a keras backend.
